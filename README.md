# Dash App
I was learning Dash, so I created this Dash app which is responsive and dynamic. It is a beginner's project, so not so much detailed.
The repo contains two datasets downloaded from Kaggle about India's exports and imports from 2010 to 2018.

The app's name is `dash-exim.py`

To run, please ensure that you have `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, and `dash` installed.
Please refer to the respective pages in order to install them.
For CSS and layout, I have used Bulma (https://bulma.io/)

As it's not in the production system, please clone the repo after installing packages and then run the app with the command

`python dash-exim.py`
